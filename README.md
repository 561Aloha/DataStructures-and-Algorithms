These are some code snippets of data structures used in everyday programming and essential for solving problems on leetcode, hackerrank, and neetcode.
Along with this, you will find code snippets I've learned that is for building more functional code (like reading and writing a file, creating abstract classes to demstrate Object Oriented Programming)

Basic Structures:
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Queues
- Front-Rear Queue
- Stacks



Some small functionalities:
- Code Snippet 1: Read a File (input_file), reverse each line and create a new file called output
